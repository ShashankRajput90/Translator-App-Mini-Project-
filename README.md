# Translator App

# Offline Language Translator with Speech and Text Capabilities

## üåü Overview
This is a Python-based **Offline Language Translator** with a user-friendly GUI that supports:
- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts spoken language from an audio file into text.
- **Text-to-Text Translation**: Translates text from one language to another.
- **Speech-to-Speech Translation**: Translates spoken input into another language and outputs the translated speech.

The app is built using state-of-the-art Machine Learning models and frameworks, making it efficient and entirely offline.
